```{r setup}

From my experience, reproducing microsimulation results is the key bottleneck of the Stata to R translation, which delays progress substantially, therefore, I suggest the best data exchange strategy. 

Step 1. Make sure that we can reproduce Stata code as is between PCs.
Step 2. Convert Existing Stata workflow to the GitHub based version control of code + OneDrive for the read-only raw data exchange.
Step 3. Start modifying Stata routines to make is transparent and translatable:
1.	Separate pre-simulation data
2.	Convert policy parameters to “globals”
3.	Make sure that those globals are not used in the grossing-up.
Step 4. Reproducing Stata using R.
Step 5. Creating Shiny App
